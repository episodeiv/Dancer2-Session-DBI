NAME
    Dancer2::Session::DBI - DBI based session engine for Dancer

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    This is a more or less faithful port of Dancer::Session::DBI to Dancer2.
    It implements a session engine by serializing the session and storing it
    in a database via DBI. The only supported serialization method is JSON.

    This was, so far, only tested with PostgreSQL but should in theory work
    with MySQL and SQLite as well, as we inherit the handling of these
    databases from the original module.

USAGE
    In config.yml

            session: 'DBI'
            engines:
                    session:
                            DBI:
                            dsn: "dbi:Pg:dbname=testing;host=127.0.0.1"
                            dbtable: "sessions"
                            dbuser: "user"
                            dbpass: "password"

    The table needs to have at least "id" and a "session_data" columns.

    A timestamp field that updates when a session is updated is recommended,
    so you can expire sessions server-side as well as client-side.

    This session engine will not automagically remove expired sessions on
    the server, but with a timestamp field as above, you should be able to
    do it manually.
